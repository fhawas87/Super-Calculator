# Super-Calculator

First college project called "Super Calculator".

First college project called "Super Calculator".

The project was about solving 10 math problems. Each function in my code is called with the problem I had to solve. For each problem there was 2 tests running. 
First test was easy to pass basically in every problem, but the second, one had some extra testes and difficult inputs. 
For example 65 bit numbers for "Count_Set_Bits" function or very big numbers for "Prime_Check" function. And also very restrictive time limits.

My best execution time was 2.121 s on the stos page.

On the Stos page which is "Student Assignment Testing and Assessment Systemfinal", my result was 95% and I was also, exempted from defending this project and from the exam of basics of programming subject.

The only 1 of 20 tests I couldn't pass was 13th test because of its time limit and huge inputs given. It was about, checking if the integer from input was prime or not. Time limit was set to 0.41000s.

Feel free to test my code with any inputs while maintaining the logic where the first number is the subproblem number, and the second number is the number of input elements.
